## Phase 3

We did our pitch for Phase 3 of Incubator funding, but unfortunately the proposal was denied. The primary feedback was:

> the question now is not whether the idea is good, it's whether the benefits are enough and the project is ready enough to warrant this size of investment from a limited pool of money

The team is disappointed, but still believes in [our proposed direction]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/phase_3_pitch_deck.pdf) ([source](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n02JdQuia-DerMp6WRsFpTtORC-UdLfcT1eIRf4AwgM/edit#slide=id.p)), in terms of cost savings, reduction of effort, etc. We aren't giving up on trying to continue Boise work, and are exploring other avenues to work towards [our goal]({{ site.baseurl }}) of improving security compliance processes. There is still significant interest in [OpenControl](http://open-control.org/) and Project Boise inside and outside of the Technology Transformation Service, so we are optimistic that we can find a good home and funding stream for it.

## Events

We were on a panel at the [NIST Risk Management Framework workshop](https://beta.csrc.nist.gov/Events/2017/NIST-Risk-Management-Framework-Workshop) about Automating ATOs, and made good connections with the attendees there. We were pleasantly surprised to find that multiple people we hadn't connected with already knew about Project Boise, and were supportive of the work.
