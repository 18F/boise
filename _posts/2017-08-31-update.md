title: Initial update
---

Hello! This is the first project update from Project Boise. While we should have started putting them out months ago, better late than never, right? We are going to try to write them up weekly.

Here's what we've been up to since the start of the project:

## Site launch

We launched this site! Most of the content was pulled out from [our pitch for the Discovery phase of the project (Phase Two)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CtrCqU4I1k6Z5oASiDGW4WnrbcQXMRZhiYcaXezN4tQ/edit#). More history on the [Background]({{ site.url }}/background/) page.

## Stakeholder interviews

We've done over twenty-five [stakeholder]({{ site.url }}/stakeholders/) interviews thus far, mostly in government agencies, but also with some vendors/contractors. We've had a lot of people reach out who are eager about the project, which is encouraging. Some interviews have been in-person when the full (distributed) team is in DC, but many have been done remotely. Getting video chat to work reliably continues to be one of the hardest problems in computer science.

We're still working on synthesis, but will get some takeaways public as soon as we can.

## Press

We've gotten some press/mentions! Highlights:

* [Blog post from former Deputy US CTO, Nick Sinai](https://medium.com/@NickSinai/ato-in-a-day-fd53f0ef4a5d)
* [_18F seeks to streamline ATO process_ from FCW](https://fcw.com/articles/2017/07/27/project-boise-ato-compliance.aspx)

## Speaking

We've been invited to speak about our work at the following events:

* [NIST Risk Management Framework Workshop](https://beta.csrc.nist.gov/Events/2017/NIST-Risk-Management-Framework-Workshop)
* [Red Hat Government Symposium](https://fedscoop.com/events/redhatgov/2017/)

## Phases

Phase Two of Project Boise is ending. The Budget for Discovery will take us to mid-September. The Technology Transformation Service (TTS)'s Incubator has a Build phase to follow Discovery, which we would give us runway to develop a Minimum Viable Product. We have started to write up plans for our next Phase and beyond; folks in GSA can see the draft [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z_ySpBlDcuT25MLYJciWyPLxUxALjC3kM6BO9j6YCs0/edit). We will get it public soon.

Happy Labor Day weekend!
