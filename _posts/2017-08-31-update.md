title: Initial update
---

Hello! This is the first project update from Project Boise. We should have started putting them out months ago&hellip; but better late than never, right? We plan to write them up weekly.

Here's what we've been up to since the start of the project:

## Site launch

We launched this site! Most of the content was pulled out from [our Discovery planning document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CtrCqU4I1k6Z5oASiDGW4WnrbcQXMRZhiYcaXezN4tQ/edit#). More history on the [Background]({{ site.url }}/background/) page.

## Stakeholder interviews

We've done over 25 [stakeholder interviews](https://methods.18f.gov/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/) thus far (here's a list of the [Project Boise stakeholders]({{ site.url }}/background/stakeholders/)). Most of our interviewees work inside of government agencies, but we've also spoken with vendors in the risk-management space. In addition to our own outreach we've heard from a lot of people who are generally interested in the project, which is encouraging. We're still working on synthesis, but will get some takeaways public as soon as we can.

In short: **the risk-management process is painful for everyone,** and improving this is not as simple as changing one piece of policy. Rather than invalidating any of [our initial expected outcomes]({{ site.url }}/pre-discovery/outcomes/), we've only found _more_ opportunity for TTS to get involved.

## Press

We've gotten some press/mentions! Highlights:

* [Blog post from former Deputy US CTO, Nick Sinai](https://medium.com/@NickSinai/ato-in-a-day-fd53f0ef4a5d)
* [_18F seeks to streamline ATO process_ from FCW](https://fcw.com/articles/2017/07/27/project-boise-ato-compliance.aspx)

## Speaking

We've been invited to speak about our work at the following events:

* [NIST Risk Management Framework Workshop](https://beta.csrc.nist.gov/Events/2017/NIST-Risk-Management-Framework-Workshop)
* [Red Hat Government Symposium](https://fedscoop.com/events/redhatgov/2017/)

## Phases

[The Discovery Phase](https://lean-product-design.18f.gov/1-discovery-research/) of Project Boise is ending in mid-September. The Technology Transformation Service (TTS)'s Incubator has a Build phase to follow Discovery, which we would give us runway to develop a Minimum Viable Product. We have started to write up plans for our next Phase and beyond; folks in GSA can see the draft [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z_ySpBlDcuT25MLYJciWyPLxUxALjC3kM6BO9j6YCs0/edit). We will get it public soon.

Happy Labor Day weekend!
