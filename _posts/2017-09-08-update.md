title: Update for week of 9/8/17
---

Hello September! Project Boise is in the home stretch of its [Discovery]({{ site.url }}/background/) phase, and is thus trying to wrap up this Phase and prepare for the next.

## Interviews

**We completed our stakeholder interviews.** The more people we talked to, the more people we realized we _could_ talk to, so this was more about cutting ourselves off (in the spirit of "fixed time/budget, flexible scope") than being "done" per se. We are greatly appreciative of the time, generosity, and openness of our 30+ interviewees.

## Artifacts

**We are working to synthesize our many dozens of pages of interview notes**, into easily-digestable quotes and takeaways that we can share publicly, while maintaining the privacy of our participants. We will be getting that information out on this site soon, and will point out the specifics in the next Update.

## Pitch

**We have the pitch for the next Phase of Incubator funding Friday 9/15.** We will be presenting to the leadership of the Technology Transformation Service (TTS), who make up the Incubator Program Advisory Board (PAB). The deck for the presentation will be posted on this site when it is complete.

The $500,000 of additional funding would allow us to expand the team. The headcount and desired skill makeup are still to-be-determined, which would determine how long that money would last. We expect the decision and money (should it be approved) to be finalized by early October.

While Discovery was about talking to people and learning, the focus of the next Phase is designing and building. In our pitch, **we will be proposing renewed focus on supporting [OpenControl](http://open-control.org/)**, potentially expanding into other compliance-related areas in the not-too-distant future.

Thanks!
