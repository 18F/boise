The [Technology Transformation Service (TTS)](https://www.gsa.gov/tts), within the [General Services Administration (GSA)](https://www.gsa.gov), buys and creates a lot of software. We encounter software compliance processes in GSA and other agencies frequently. ATOs are cited as a major pain point for TTS and project partners, as it can add significant burden to the project in terms of time and cost. Federal software security compliance is not a core competency of most of our teams, making getting an ATO even harder.

Project Boise was pitched and then funded by [the TTS Incubator](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tgSTHIrgtUUd-kV6pZE_A-IHOo6Dog7VsIl01qfcYUs/edit) in May 2017 for a Discovery phase, which is meant to evaluate the landscape of the problem, do research, and then determine what next steps should be. This funding should last through mid-September. Aside from this site and a large number of Google Docs, we have not "built" or "fixed" anything, and don't intend to for the duration of Discovery.

The name "Project Boise" is completely arbitrary. It was chosen to avoid influencing product or marketing decisions during the Discovery phase. A state capital seemed like a good code name.
