## Long-term

The Project Boise team's long-term goals include:

- Reducing the burden (time, cost, and pain) around compliance.
- Designing compliance processes that better evaluate the security of systems
- Providing paths and removing barriers to increasing the security of systems
- Improving the visibility of and confidence in the security of systems

## Short-term

More tactically, here are the primary things that Boise will complete in the first ~month:

1. First, we will **pick up existing conversations** that members of the Boise team have had around ATOs, making sure they are aware of Boise, and submit this pitch for feedback.
1. Second, we will **identify and map common compliance journeys**. While NIST's [Risk Management Framework](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fisma/framework.html) provides a high-level view, our team wants to more fully understand the information ecosystems created across federal agencies: what are the various touchpoints, by the various stakeholders, etc? From there we want to categorize what detailed parts of the process are hard vs. soft requirements, and which are government-wide vs. varying by agency.
1. Third, we will finish **mapping the [areas of ATO work](../../pre-discovery/areas/)**. We will take those various efforts and see where they fall along the mapping, to understand overlap/gaps. This will help steer Boise towards a specific area of the ATO process that is un(der)addressed.
