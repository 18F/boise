## Why is it called "Project Boise"?

Totally arbitrary. See the [Background](../background/) page.

## Are you going to "fix" ATOs?

No. See the [Knowns](../knowns/) page.

## What makes the team qualified to work on ATOs?

We aren't, really. At least not on our own. See the [Overview](../).

## How does Project Boise relate to...

### FedRAMP?

**Both**

* Deal with software risk management
* Are housed within the Technology Transformation Service (TTS)
* Are frequently communicating with one another

**FedRAMP**

* Has been around much longer
* Is focused on shared cloud services
    * Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
    * Software as a Service (SaaS)

**Project Boise**

* Is doing Discovery, meaning we are in a much more exploratory phase
* Has a broader focus, in that we are interested in ATOs for all software, rather than just shared services
* Ideally will produce something useful for FedRAMP and beyond

### The Office of American Innovation (OAI) ATO work stream?

**Both**

* Started around the same time
* Are/were convening groups across government to talk about how to improve ATOs
* Are/were doing "user"/stakeholder research with agencies

* Have an unclear future

**OAI**

* Has the convening power of the White House
* Isn't looking to "build"/"own" anything

**Project Boise**
