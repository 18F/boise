## How does Project Boise relate to...

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>FedRAMP?</summary>
  **Both**

  * Deal with software risk management
  * Are housed within the Technology Transformation Service (TTS)
  * Are frequently communicating with one another

  **FedRAMP**

  * Has been around much longer
  * Is focused on shared cloud services
      * Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
      * Software as a Service (SaaS)

  **Project Boise**

  * Is doing Discovery, meaning we are in a much more exploratory phase
  * Has a broader focus, in that we are interested in ATOs for all software, rather than just shared services
  * Ideally will produce something useful for FedRAMP and beyond
