First and foremost, **the Project Boise team will produce and publish artifacts documenting our findings from discovery.** This way, even if the project does not proceed, there will be materials available for future work around ATOs.

That being said, the Boise team expects to pursue **one or more of following paths** after our Discovery concludes. Note that none of these paths are mutually exclusive.

## Consulting

GSA's Technology Transformation Service (TTS) already offers consulting in a number of areas — having a team dedicated to helping with security compliance would be a way to enact change from the bottom-up. This could come in a couple of forms.

First, TTS could offer (paid) assistance in helping teams in other agencies complete their ATOs. This is in line with TTS’s new approach of having agencies be responsible for ATOs as TTS is building the systems… TTS just becomes a kind of ATO sherpa.

Second, TTS could help agencies reform their risk-management processes. This could happen in conjunction with shepherding projects through the agency's existing processes; once we've navigated it a few times, we could obtain a holistic view of how ATOs work at that agency. It could come in conjunction with infrastructure modernization and [being more prescriptive around their technologies/practices](../hypotheses/#prescriptiveness-is-good), to improve their security posture and reduce effort spent on compliance and reinventing the security wheel.

## Tooling

TTS could build tools to help facilitate processes related to obtaining/granting an ATO. For example:

### Authoring Documentation 

Documentation is an (often disproportionately) large part of the process leading up to an ATO, and it is often difficult for teams without compliance experience (which is most of them) to complete. Helping teams produce required documentation could have a major impact on the timeline to getting their ATO. This could mean guiding users through producing their documentation, having easier collaboration around it, and/or building that documentation from reusable components, or as code. If this tool were able to produce the same (hopefully better) results in the same format that traditional authoring would, it could be used without the knowledge of (or requiring buy-in from) the documentation reviewers/auditors.

### Assessment

Assessment might involve one or more compliance (not necessarily technical) specialists going through the documentation to try and understand the security risk/protections of the system. A ssessors could then work with the project team to have them prove/attest/verify each of their claims on the “Implementation Status” of their controls. This is done through evidence gathering, which takes the form of screenshots, artifacts, interviews, and/or testing. 

Attestation and verification are often highly manual and subjective processes, and because the assessors only have limited context about the system or technical capabilities, there can be significant knowledge gaps in knowing what to look for and what may be in place. Depending on the ATO process, some parts of the assessment need to be done at regular intervals, so each system taken on increases the assessment burden linearly. The reporting of these ongoing assessments often come in the form of manually-created documents and spreadsheets sent back and forth, which is time-consuming to produce and compare, and leaves lots of room for human error.

Tooling around assessment can come in the form of helping their review and communication around the documentation, or having more automation to do the verifications/reporting.

### A team to push on policy

A top-down approach might mean working with specific groups across the federal government on internal security policy. This is not something TTS is currently setup to do in a consistent way. Having a group dedicated to working with policymakers on improving ATOs (perhaps with a timebox) could go a long way in making improvements to the burden and effectiveness of compliance government-wide. Practically, it would mean taking steps back to look at security compliance more holistically, designing the process to meet and encourage modern software development, devops, and security best practices. However, progress through policy has too many external/extraneous/inter-dependencies that make it hard to predict the real vs predicted/potential value add.
