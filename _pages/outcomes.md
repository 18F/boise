First and foremost, **the Boise team will produce artifacts of our findings from discovery** and publish them as widely as we can. Therefore, even if the project did not proceed, there will be materials available for the stakeholders and any future work around ATOs.

That being said, **one or more of the following are the expected paths forward for Boise** after the Discovery phase. None are mutually exclusive.

## Consulting

TTS already offers consulting in a number of areas — having a team dedicated to helping with security compliance would be a way to fulfill the bottom-up approach. This could come in a couple of forms.

First, TTS could offer (paid) assistance in helping program teams in other agencies complete their ATOs. This is in line with TTS’s new approach of having agencies be responsible for ATOs as TTS is building the systems…TTS just becomes the sherpas.

Second, TTS could help agencies reform their own ATO process. This could happen in conjunction with shepherding their projects through ATOs, giving a more holistic view of how ATOs work at that agency. It could come in conjunction with infrastructure modernization and [being more prescriptive around their technologies/practices](../hypotheses/#prescriptiveness-is-good), to improve their security posture and reduce effort spent on compliance and reinventing the security wheel.

## Tooling

Tooling could be built to help with various pain points on multiple sides of the ATO process.

### Documentation authoring

Documentation is an (often disproportionately) large part of the ATO process, and is difficult for teams without compliance experience (which is most of them) to complete. Helping teams to produce required documentation could have a major impact on the timeline to getting their ATO. This could mean guiding users through producing their documentation, having easier collaboration around it, and/or building that documentation from reusable components, or as code. If this tool were able to produce the same (hopefully better) results in the same format that traditional authoring would, it could be used without the knowledge of (or requiring buy-in from) the documentation reviewers/auditors.

### Assessment

Once documentation is produced, assessment means one or more compliance (though not necessarily technical) specialists going through the documentation to try and understand the security risk/protections of the system. The assessors then work with the project team to have them prove/attest/verify each of their claims on the “Implementation Status” of their controls. This is done through evidence gathering, which takes the form of screenshots, artifacts, interviews, and/or testing. This is often a highly manual and subjective process, and because the assessors only have limited context about the system or technical capabilities, there can be significant knowledge gaps in knowing what to look for and what may be in place. Depending on the ATO process, some parts of the assessment need to be done at regular intervals, so each system taken on increases the assessment burden linearly. The reporting of these ongoing assessments often come in the form of manually-created documents and spreadsheets sent back and forth, which is time-consuming to produce and compare, and leaves lots of room for human error.

Tooling around assessment can come in the form of helping their review and communication around the documentation, or having more automation to do the verifications/reporting.

### A team to push on policy

The top-down approach means working with specific groups in federal government on internal security policy, which is not something TTS is currently setup to do in a consistent way. Having a group dedicated to working with policymakers on improving ATOs (perhaps with a timebox) could go a long way in making improvements to the burden and effectiveness of compliance government-wide. It could mean taking steps back to look at security compliance more holistically, designing the process to meet and encourage modern software development, devops, and security best practices. However, progress through policy has too many external/extraneous/inter-dependencies that make it hard to predict the real vs predicted/potential value add.
