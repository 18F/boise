- "ATO" is a very broad concept, and involves a large number of stakeholders.  
- The ATO process is universally painful for folks both inside and outside government.
- ATOs impose a significant burden on all agency software projects / acquisitions. They are a consistent blocker to delivery.
- Requirements and processes vary by agency and context (such as internal systems vs. SaaS), so making a one-size-fits-all solution is difficult.
- There is lots of [ATO improvement work](areas/) already happening in/around government. Assessing their scope, their "completeness", their effectiveness, and then the gaps will inform the our future work. We may also find opportunities for consolidation/collaboration between existing efforts.
- GSA/TTS has no regulatory authority. We will need to collaborate with NIST, DHS, and/or OMB if we want to induce policy changes.
