- We (and others) refer to "ATOs", "ATO processes", and "software risk management" somewhat interchangeably, but they are different.
- **No single entity, including Project Boise, can "fix" ATOs.** Software risk management is a broad field, and involves a large number of stakeholders and semi-distinct processes with varying connections between them.
- The ATO process is universally painful for folks both inside and outside government.
- ATOs impose a significant burden on all agency software projects/acquisitions. They are a consistent blocker to delivery.
- Requirements and processes vary by agency and context (such as internal systems vs. SaaS), so making a one-size-fits-all solution is difficult.
- There is lots of [ATO improvement work](../areas/) already happening in/around government.
    - Assessing their scope, their "completeness", their effectiveness, and then the gaps will inform the our future work.
    - We may find opportunities for consolidation/collaboration between existing efforts, but have no intention of repeating their effort or competing.
- **GSA/TTS has no regulatory authority.** We will need to collaborate with NIST, DHS, and/or OMB if we want to induce policy changes, and learn [the bounds within which we can do so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_administrative_law).
